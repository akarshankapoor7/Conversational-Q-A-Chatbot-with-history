This Conversational Q&A Chatbot is a Generative AI project built using LangChain to enable intelligent, context-aware interactions. The chatbot retains memory of past exchanges, ensuring a seamless and coherent conversation flow.

To incorporate chat history effectively, the project implements two approaches:

Chains: A structured method that always retrieves relevant context before generating a response.

Agents: A more flexible approach where the LLM dynamically decides when and how to retrieve past information, allowing for multiple retrieval steps if needed.

By leveraging LangChain's retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, the chatbot delivers more accurate and contextually relevant answers. This project showcases the power of Generative AI in building interactive, intelligent assistants.
